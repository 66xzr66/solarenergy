                    <div class="divider"></div>
                    <p>Solar energy is energy that is produced by the sunâ€™s rays. It is a form of renewable energy, which means it is replenished naturally and can be used over and over again. Solar energy can be captured and converted into electricity using solar panels, which are made up of photovoltaic (PV) cells. These cells convert sunlight into electricity through a process called the photovoltaic effect.</p>

                <div class="divider"></div>
                <p>In a nutshell, a solar panel works by generating electricity when particles of sunlight, or photons, knock electrons free from atoms, setting them in motion. This flow of electrons is electricity, and solar panels are designed to capture this flow, turning it into a usable electric current. This process is called the photovoltaic effect, and is the foundational chemical and physical process behind the vast majority of solar technology.</p>

                    <div class="divider2"></div>
                <p>Kazakhstan's energy industry relies heavily <br> on fossil fuels, which pollutes the <br> environment. In Kazakhstan, coal-fired power <br> plants account for <br> 
                    about 70% of the electricity produced. And <br> in the future, in order not to depend on <br> fossil fuels while not polluting the <br> environment, Kazakhstan has to <br>
                    transition to "green" economic growth by <br> introducing clean energy production.
